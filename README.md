Hi ğŸ‘‹

I'm Ian. I enjoy writing code and creating data pipelines ğŸ¤“.

My background is in the social sciences and statistics, and I've worked as a freelance data scientist for multiple organizations, both public and private. Currently, I'm working with data in the realm of governmental relations (RelGov) and the oil industry.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django, Prefect (pipeline orchestration tool), and software development
- ğŸ”¦ I'm interested in data engineering, quantitative finance, and building cool stuff
